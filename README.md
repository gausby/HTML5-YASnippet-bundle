# Opinionated HTML5 YASnippet Bundle

I have some opinions about how I want my HTML. This YASnippet bundle reflects that.

Feel free to fork this bundle and make it your own, If you don't agree on my style.

The structure of this package is taken from [Magnar Sveen](https://github.com/magnars/)'s snippet package for the buster unit test framework, [buster-snippets.el](https://github.com/magnars/buster-snippets.el).


## Install

Clone the project and add the folder to the emacs load path.

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/html5-snippets")
    ;; some time after yasnippet has been loaded execute this
    (require 'html5-snippets)

The snippets should now expand in both html-mode and web-mode.


## Todo

  * Write some documentation.
  * Write a todo-list.
