# HTML5 YASnippet Bundle

I have some opinions about how I want my HTML. This YASnippet bundle
reflects that.

Feel free to fork this bundle and make it your own, If
you don't agree on my style.

## Todo

I haven't done snippets for the following elements:

  - audio-element
  - video-, source- and track-element
  - keygen-element
  - meter-element
  - object-element
  - output-element
  - progress-element
